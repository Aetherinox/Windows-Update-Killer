# Windows Update Killer
This is a simple no-nonsense script to pause Windows update until 2040.
Pretty much allowing you to update whenever you want instead of waking up to a rebooted machine.

## Install
- Download the `.reg` file to your computer.
- Right click on the file and select `Open With`
- Select `Registry Editor`
- Click `Yes` when prompted if you're sure you wish to continue
- Confirm the change by clicking `Start` and type `Windows Update`
