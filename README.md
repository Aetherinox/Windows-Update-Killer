# Windows Update Killer
This is a simple no-nonsense script to pause Windows update until 2040.
Pretty much allowing you to update whenever you want instead of waking up to a rebooted machine.

## Install
> [!NOTE]
> Depending on your machine's configuration, you may be able to double-click the `.reg` file and auto-install it.

- Download the `.reg` file to your computer.
- Right click on the file and select `Open With`
- Select `Registry Editor`
- Click `Yes` when prompted if you're sure you wish to continue
- Confirm the change by clicking `Start` and type `Windows Update`
- Keep the script somewhere in case you need to reinstall / wipe your machine.

## Why?
I was tired of the complicated methods. I don't like having my machine reboot and me not being able to control Windows Update. It's my biggest pet peeve with Windows. This script makes my life so much easier because now I don't have to deal with it. The point was just to have a stupid simple solution using a script anyone can open in notepad and view the code. Without fear of viruses and people injecting crap onto your system. Enjoy.
